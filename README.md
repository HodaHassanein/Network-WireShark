# Network-WireShark
The main objective of the project was to utilize Wireshark's capabilities to conduct ping tests and examine the network's responsiveness. The ping command is commonly used to assess network connectivity by sending an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request to a specific host and measuring the response time.
